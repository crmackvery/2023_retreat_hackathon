# 2023 Retreat Hackathon

## Getting Started

Welcome to the 2023 retreat hackathon. The goal of this project is to get you (a web or mobile based software engineer) familiar with some common tools of IoT development primarily from the perspective of hardware and firmware. To that end, we will be covering:

- [First time Nerves setup](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/getting-started.html) and basic Nerves/Elixir programming patterns
- Basic wiring and development tools for firmware
- Interacting with the serial console (UART, debugging)
- Using pinout diagrams
- Lower level protocol usage (I2C)
- Using datasheets
- Cloud connectivity best practices (Wifi setup, AWS IoT Core)
- Basic cloud communication (Mqtt)
