# Connect the sensor

- Use the Qwiic JST SH wire to connect the AHT20 sensor to the rpi0.
- The AHT20 communicates over the I2C protocol so you can use the pinout for [the rpi0](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/i2c) and the [AHT20 qwiic connect](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/custom_pages/2/7/2/QwiicPinoutGraphic.jpg) to determine how to connect the wires.
- Once the sensor is connected to the rpi0 and receiving power, a green LED should light up on the board.
